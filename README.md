Hello my name is Israel Rosario Jr. I am a brand new coder with the desire to land a job as a junior web developer.
My hobbies are playing chess, gadgets, and reading. I am married 23 years to my faithful wife, Christine, and three daughters.
I live in the state of Pennsylvania. Iam currently in the retail sector, which sometimes feels like a slow death. :-)
